Notes for `jsconfig.json`:

- compilerOptions.target/module: Control JS language support for editors and tools.
- checkJs: Enable checking JS files without TypeScript.
- baseUrl: Base directory for module resolution.
- exclude: Files/folders excluded from editor tooling.

This sidecar provides context because JSON doesn't allow inline comments.
